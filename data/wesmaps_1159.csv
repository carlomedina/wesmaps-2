This deep uncertainty regarding art's relationship to society coincided with an era of unprecedented formal innovation. Artists struggled to define the costs and benefits of abstraction versus figuration, moving abruptly, even violently, between the two idioms. The extremism of artistic solutions speaks to a fundamental instability, if not outright crisis, in European art, society, and politics. This course will introduce students to the major avant-garde art movements from the first half of the 20th century as they took root in France, Germany, Italy, Holland, and Russia. Our focus will be on painting, but we will also look at attempts to go beyond painting in an attempt to gain greater immediacy or social relevance for art. Topics that will receive special emphasis include the relationship between abstraction and figuration, the impact of primitivism and contact with non-Western arts, modernism's relationship to mass culture, modernism and classicism, war and revolution, gender and representation, art and dictatorship, and the utopian impulse to have the arts redesign society as a whole."

Focusing on key works since the 1960s, with an eye to historical examples (Marcel Duchamp, El Lissitzky, etc.), this course situates the exhibition form relative to installation art, institutional critique, and the implications for class and the production of value of a new ""curatorial condition"" in the larger culture (where data specialists now curate information, an artisan cheese shop curates its merchandise, and anyone with a social media account curates a presentation of self)."

Practices linked to the early 20th-century avant-garde (such as abstraction, the readymade, Dada, and surrealism) echoed in these years as attention gradually shifted away from the canvas and studio and toward expanded contexts of reception and public experience. The boundaries of the art object transformed in turn as artists developed new forms and new models of spectatorship to confront a world that had placed enormous pressure on traditional concepts of humanist subjectivity.

These mythical and legendary figures, such as Guanyin, Mazu, and Nie Xiaoqian, empowered both women and men who were in poverty, peril, or despair. Their heroic and divine images combine traits of feminine qualities highlighted in a male-chauvinistic tradition and symbols of a mega-being beyond any gender-specific definition. By tracing the formation and transformation of images of women in the art of China and Taiwan, this course will explore three themes: (1) the development of female cults in the visual cultures of China and Taiwan; (2) the relationship of feminine representation, human morality, and divine power in Chinese and Taiwanese societies; (3) the negotiation of political and cultural identities in these societies through the appropriation of female images.

Despite complex historical relationships between the two traditions, modern scholarship has tended to emphasize their separate identities as distinct, isolable schools with mutually opposing stylistic and aesthetic ideals. Mughal painting is often characterized as naturalistic, rational, and political, while contemporary Rajput work is seen as lyrical, erotic, and spiritual in its approach. In this course, we will trace the history of the emergence and interaction of these two traditions of painting, beginning with the pre-Mughal and pre-Rajput traditions current before the 16th century and continuing to the transformation of the Mughal and Rajput traditions through British colonial patronage. The course strikes a balance between the modes of historical survey and thematic enquiry; some of the themes to be examined include the relationship between painting and literature, the structure of patronage and the degree of the patron's influence in shaping style, and the extent to which the Mughal and Rajput styles appropriated formal conventions from 16th-century European prints and paintings."

The four goals provide a useful key for understanding Indian intellectual history in its classical moment--roughly, the half millennium between the second and seventh centuries. This pivotal era witnessed the definition of new forms of social and political thought, the creation of new types of expressive literature in Sanskrit, and the crystallization of the Hindu religion. In this course, we explore classical Indian thought through a variety of theoretical and literary texts articulating the ideas and values of the age. Most of these works were originally written in Sanskrit, the ancient Indian language of culture and power that served as a lingua franca uniting vast portions of Southern Asia.

We begin with Moses, the first mountain climber. We then turn to the first historical mountain climber: Oetzi, the 5,200 year-old man found frozen in the ice high in the Tyrolian Alps. We then turn to medieval Europe. There, passes through the Alps and the Black Forest were conduits for the transit of men, goods, and cultural forms. Mountains were not barriers but passageways that linked cultures. In 16th- and 17th-century Europe, Netherlandish artists--Breughel, Seghers, Ruisdael, Jos de Mompers--first gave full expression to the grandeur, far beyond a human scale, of Alpine scenery. Gradually, mountains came to be viewed as places of aesthetic beauty and as manifestation of the sublime. Romanticism, in the visual arts, poetry, and music, captures the experience of the Alps as both symbol and physical manifestation of the transcendent. In the paintings of C. D. Friedrich, Constable, and Turner, mountains become the means to express the concept of the Sublime. A deeper understanding of the Sublime may be found in the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge. In America, too, mid-19th century painters focused on the mountains, We will study Hudson River School artists represented in CT collections (Church, Cole). The mid-19th century saw the birth of mountaineering as a sport. We will read selections from narratives of climbing expeditions--Leslie Stephen, Mark Twain. After World War I, mountaineering took on a heightened spiritual dimension for men who had survived the horrors of trench warfare. In Austria and Germany, climbing was identified with the cult of physical prowess and, sadly, with National Socialism and anti-Semitism. In fact, however, the development of climbing and skiing in the Alps owes much to Austrian and German Jews. In art, too, during the first decades of the 20th century, mountains were an important source of spiritual inspiration for painters whose work is central to the evolution of modern art."

Each object sheds light on the history, religion, and culture of the region from which it comes. The trans-Saharan trade was crucial to both North and West Africa. From Morocco came the Muslim religion, as well as Islamic architecture. In 1445 Portuguese mariners arrived on the Atlantic coast of West Africa. From that moment on, West Africa has been part of a global economy. Already by 1500, the growth of Creole Euro-African communities is reflected in artwork. ""Art"" is best understood in the specific historical context and the culture in which it develops. To us, removed in space and in time from these African societies, architecture, sculpture, and ritual performance help to illuminate the lives of the people we are studying. Ultimately, we will consider such questions as: Does African art exist? What is ""African art""? Who defines art--Africans or Westerners?"

Sacred, sacrifice, sacrament, saint, consecrate, sacrilege, desecrate. The many words associated with it demonstrate how the idea of sacredness pervades the English language. ""Sacred"" serves as a common qualifier that implicitly suggests a similarity in the structure of religious practices, experiences, and worldviews, while describing a difference between the mundane and the spiritual or religious. European imperialism projected such a universal use of the notion, whitewashing important divergences with non-Christian religions. So what makes the sacred sacred?

These images tell us much about how members of one culture viewed the distant peoples with whom they were just coming into contact. The earliest European Renaissance paintings of Africans show them as dignitaries and often as rulers (e.g. ""The Adoration of the Magi""). This reflects the presence in Europe of African dignitaries, both secular and religious.

We will also examine the ways in which art was incorporated in the practice of Zen rituals, especially those related to meditation, gardening, and the tea ceremony, and how they were juxtaposed with literary k'an (gong'an in Chinese and kong'an in Korean) to form visual and textual mind puzzles based on allusions and wordplay.

Understood as the intention to reunite the arts into one integrated work, the Gesamtkunstwerk was tied from the beginning to the desire to recover and renew the public function of art. True to its origins in revolution, the modern idea of the total work of art intends a critique of existing society and anticipates a utopian alternative. This course examines modern formulations of totality as a response to a cultural crisis initiated by the 1789 French Revolution. From there, we turn to an analysis of composer Richard Wagner's ideas and compositions, which made the idea of the synthesis of the arts a central focus for European modernism. Yet if Wagner's works and writings provide the dominant reference for subsequent developments from the 1880s onwards, these appear primarily in the form of a search for alternatives to his own theory and practice. Attempts to unite the arts and the arts with life continued until the 1930s, when artists' utopian dreams of the total work found perverted realization in the propaganda machines put in place by totalitarian governments. This course examines the origins of the Gesamtkunstwerk in French Revolutionary festivals and German idealism before shifting to a focus on Wagner and the total work of art. It will then examine attempts to envision totality after Wagner in Impressionist painting and German expressionism before concluding with a look at Nazi festivals and art exhibitions."

We will focus on the Republic primarily as a work of moral psychology this semester by investigating the topical question of the dialogue: why is it better to live justly rather than unjustly?  For Plato, a just life is one governed by the pursuit of wisdom or learning, and this he believes will also be a psychologically healthy one. By contrast, a life governed by the indiscriminate pursuit of power--the life of a tyrant--is psychologically corrupted. These are bold claims. What is Plato's argument for them? In raising this question, we will consider the political project Plato embarks upon in the Republic in constructing a just society, as well as connected issues he raises in the dialogue concerning the nature of human motivation, the distinction between belief and knowledge, the distinction between appearance and reality, the importance of a proper education to the human good, and the role of art and beauty in furthering the common good.

To understand how the picaresque accomplishes this, we will look at its interplay with competing, often idealizing, genres (such as autobiography, lives of saints and soldiers, inquisitorial confessions, the arts of letter writing, etc.), together with political theory and natural-law theories of the period.

Although they represent discrete realities--not all Gypsies identify with flamenco; not all flamenco artists are Gypsies--correlations between the two have nonetheless been exploited by the media and by artists as an often unwanted emblem of Spanishness. The tensions surrounding this practice seem related to an undisputed fact of Spanish cultural history: flamenco is unique within European culture; with a population of nearly one million Gypsies are Spain's dominant minority; yet recognition of the artistic value of the former and acceptance and assimilation of the latter have been slow to congeal within Spanish society. Our practical aim will be to analyze these important aspects of Spanish culture in their historical context. We will study how the connection between Gypsies and flamenco has emerged; we will evaluate the extent to which it is valid; and we will attempt to assess what seems to be at stake in the struggles between those who promote and those who resist this connection as distinctive of Spanish national culture. In doing so, we seek to foster a deeper understanding of the importance of the Roma community within the framework of European and Spanish culture and a deeper appreciation for flamenco as a unique form of cultural expression. On the theoretical plane, we seek to understand how music, dance, literature, cinema, performance, and art can give expression to ethnicity, how cultural hegemonies emerge, and what role artists play in supporting or contesting those hegemonies.

Students are given writing exercises developed by playwright Maria Irene Fornes to create original material; they will view/read works that use animals and the sci-fi genre examining the work for themes, character, plot, and the use of other elements in performance to break up the narrative, e.g., lectures and interviews. Participants will use the Liz Lerman critical response process for performance. Students will also work as research assistants for Tropicana. Schwanze-Beast (S-B) is a (work in progress) full-length performance with video/set installation by Carmelita Tropicana and Ela Troyano.

This course will approach the problems and possibilities of the city for realism through a close reading of two large, ambitious texts that attempt to represent the city as a totality: James Joyce's novel ULYSSES (1922) and David Simon's television series THE WIRE (2002-2008). We will be particularly concerned with two techniques, pioneered by Joyce, for representing the city: stream of consciousness, which creates a tour of the city from the perspective of a single, mobile fl�neur; and montage, which creates a map of the city by juxtaposing various cross-sections of social life or various institutions central to the city's functioning."

We will examine fundamental categories of the literary Baroque, such as wit (agudeza) and desenga�o (disenchantment), and the 17th-century equivalent of the nature-nurture debate (nature-art) and situate them in relation to scientific, political, and religious revolutions of the period. We will therefore explore ways in which 17th-century Spanish culture--far from being focused on decline and decay--optimistically embraced change and pioneered a proto-democratic aesthetic. We will look at diverse Baroque literary phenomena, from poetry to satire, from theories of invention and wit (Gracián, Tesauro, Pallavicino) to picaresque narrative, and from New World Baroque expressions ('Barroco de Indias') to political treatises.

New approaches were likewise taken in the humanities, social sciences, psychology, medicine, science, and technology, and new ideas about sexuality, the body, and the role of women were introduced.

These perennial questions gained new urgency in the time period between 1700 and 1830, when a large number of long-held assumptions about society, culture, and the world in general were undergoing dramatic changes. Adherents of the Enlightenment and subsequent intellectual movements have almost always fought their battles against the established order by insisting that they were pursuing reality over appearance and truth over falseness and madness. This strategy of positioning oneself on the side of truth and one's opponents on the side of lies and insanity is still employed in discourse today and is often difficult to combat in the interest of attaining a more nuanced understanding of reality. In this seminar, we will look at some of the seminal literary texts of the period between the rise of the Enlightenment and the beginning of industrialized modernity to try to understand how truth and reality were strategically employed, why it seemed to make sense to contrast reality with madness, and what happened when the line between the real and the unreal, truth and lie, became blurred.

It means you know what's going to happen before it happens. And you can also listen backward, way back, know the generations gone by."" Relating the ""earth ear"" to contemporary technology, he says that it is made up of Inyan Tunka, an ""ancient rock computer;"" wakiksuyapi, a ""hot line to the spirits"" through the interpretation of signs; as well as the history sedimented in the Lakota language: a wonderful cyborgian concept that mixes memory, prediction, and the deep ancestral time of the oldest beings, rocks. This is a powerful manifestation of what ethnomusicologist Roshanak Kheshti has called aural positionality, ""an ethnographic production practice that works through and with the formal capacities of sound so as to make use of the medium's potential in constructing representations of culture."" GPS for the ear? In Crow Dog's account, a medicine man is describing a spiritual practice in relation to the earth; in Kheshti's, an ethnomusicologist is accounting for an ethics of representation through her listening and production practices in the context of World Music; but in both, it is a matter of attuning oneself through the ear. In this course, we will attune our ears to archives of Native American music by paying close attention to the practice of ethnomusicology, theories of the archive and auditory cultures, issues of intellectual property (including the digitization and publication of archival materials), practices and values of production, and the repatriation of songs and revitalization of Native American ways of life. We will also explore Native American epistemologies and spiritual practices, as well as the sensory and affective aspects of sound. By focusing on the 'earth ear' as a site of interaction, listening becomes an activity by which recorded sound's social, ethical, and aesthetic positioning is conveyed to the listener. Through differential positioning, then, we will explore the intervals between sound and sight, singing and hearing, and music, sound, and language. With this in mind, we will conduct research in Wesleyan's World Music Archive, while comparing it to alternative archives (such as the Women's Audio Archive and various acoustic and sensory ecology archives) that question the archival conventions by which sound, music, and culture are constituted as a homogeneous whole and challenge the perpetration of relations of subordination between sound, sense, and identity."

Every action, every emotion, every decision and recognition in the drama is conveyed to the audience in multiple and sometimes contradictory ways. Operas are also fantastic, living experiments in the performative representation of human sexuality. In addition to all of the love and sex that occurs explicitly on the opera stage--and there is plenty of that--operatic narratives also bear witness to changing structures of normativity; regimes of social control are thematized, sometimes lampooned, and often transgressed within the drama, and operas allow us to see how this unfolds within an interconnected ensemble of media. This course serves to introduce students to the world of the opera stage and, through that world, the foundational texts of queer theory.

This course will serve as a general introduction to post-tonal music theory and will also serve as an introduction to the music of the Second Viennese School: Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern.

Composition splintered into diverse idioms and methods: the minimalism of Steve Reich, impressionism of Claude Debussy, and indeterminacy of John Cage, to name only a few. Often, the proponents of one school vehemently rejected the techniques of the others. Perhaps as a result of such schisms, the audience for classical music--particularly contemporary composition--diminished in size, to the point that critics were hailing the ""postclassical era"" by the 1990s. The concert hall ceased to be a showcase for contemporary compositions and became a kind of museum devoted to preserving (and occasionally reinventing) canonic works of the past. Commercial popular musics such as jazz and rock eclipsed classical music in audience appeal and relevance. While some composers attracted listeners through their interface with folk and popular musics or with film (e.g., Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein), others preferred to cultivate small, but devoted audiences of initiates for their challenging works (e.g., Milton Babbitt, Arnold Schoenberg). Meanwhile, the advent of mass-produced sound recordings enabled music from distant times and places to be preserved, transported, and heard on demand, with profound consequences for the creation, performance, and consumption of music. In this course, we will explore the many trends that have marked classical musicking in the 20th century. Through extensive listening assignments and primary source readings, we'll meet many of the century's influential composers, performers, critics, record producers, pedagogues, patrons, and listeners. In discussions and writing, we'll explore what the past century's legacy means for us as musicians and listeners today. While previous experience with music is useful, it is not a requirement for success in this course."

In practice, however, its objects and methods are far narrower. In the postwar era, musicology was almost exclusively concerned with the verification, classification, and explication of pre-1900 European art music. Scholarship focused on the music itself apart from performance, consumption, and social context. In other words, it treated music as a set of works: autonomous aesthetic entities not subject to social, cultural, or economic forces. Such works were assembled into a canon, implying a clear trajectory of historical progress. Ethnomusicology and the so-called new musicology of the 1980s and 90s posed challenges to this musicological status quo. New approaches conceptualized music as an event unfolding in time rather than a reified artifact. Inspired by postcolonial, feminist, and queer theoretical models, scholars questioned the canon and its master narrative of great compositions by white men. They critiqued the positivist model of music scholarship as an accumulation of facts, chronologies, and authoritative printed editions. Despite this upheaval in the discipline, a quick survey of recent article and abstract titles in the American Musicological Society's quarterly journal or annual conference program shows that traditional research topics and methods persist. This course will explore musicology's scholarly purview, history, methods, and debates, past and present. How do musicologists' and composers' pursuits intertwine in historical narratives and contemporary music departments? How do the ""intermediaries"" of notated score, performer, and sound recording influence scholarship? What's the purpose of musical analysis? How should analysis proceed when scholars have largely agreed that its ""object"" is not a fixed object at all? How does the study of popular music fit (or not) into the disciplines of musicology and ethnomusicology? What's at stake in keeping musicology separate from ethnomusicology in scholarly societies, journals, and, indeed, graduate training? Reading assignments will include a combination of influential ""classics"" (e.g., Eduard Hanslick's ON THE MUSICALLY BEAUTIFUL), watershed texts of the new musicology (e.g., excerpts from Joseph Kerman's CONTEMPORARY MUSIC and Susan McClary's FEMININE ENDINGS), and essays representing recent trends in the field (e.g., sound studies, ecomusicology, and the ""affective turn"" in the humanities).

From the Cuban José Martí to the Colombian García Márquez, from the Spaniard Miguel de Unamuno to the U.S. socialist Waldo Frank, from, to be sure, the powerful tradition of the Latin America essay with its identity politics to the U.S.-led Pan Americanism of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Bolívar has been made to serve complex and important functions in discourse about national and continental identity. To consider all this, we will study a number of rewritings of Bolívar's life and works, focusing on the dynamic process in which literary, cultural, and political traditions have been formed around him, while giving special attention to issues bearing on race, gender, and modernization. A wide range of texts will be examined, including letters, essays, poems, novels, screenplays, and films."

The term psychophysical action was coined by Russian director and pedagogue Konstantin Stanislavsky, who dedicated his life's work to the elaboration of the first Western acting system. Stanislavsky viewed the acting conventions of Romanticism and melodrama as ""false,"" inadequate, and pass�. As a proponent of realism, then an emerging theatrical genre, Stanislavsky sought to develop an acting system that would support the creation of ""truthful"" actions on stage. The late Polish director Jerzy Grotowski continued Stanislavsky's research on the method of psychophysical actions. In response to the theatrical trends of his time, Grotowski's own research aimed at freeing actors from the conventions and materials of realism. Instead of departing from dramatic literature, students in this course will learn how to create psychophysical actions using points of departure such as personal memory, short stories, poems, visual materials, objects, traditional song, and so forth. The goal is to guide them to create repeatable scores of psychophysical actions; select, extend, and/or omit specific fragments in their score; juxtapose text or song to the physical score; and use objects in a manner that is precise and expressive. During the second half of the semester, students will learn how to ""edit"" their scores of psychophysical actions in partner and ensemble work.

Relatedly, the discourse of the human is often invoked in movements for political equality, inclusion, and enfranchisement, i.e., the call to ""human rights."" Yet recent literature within the field of American studies broadly, and, more specifically, within the area of critical animal studies, has called these assumptions into question. In this junior colloquium, we will explore these critical turns in the field, by considering the boundaries between the animal, human, and technological realms. Important concepts addressed will include the utilization of animals as research subjects, food, and labor; the ""nonhuman personhood"" movement; intersectionalities between ideas of social difference and the posthuman; concepts of disability, debility, and capacity; technological enhancements of the human body; and cybercultural identities. Students will have the opportunity to engage with a wide variety of materials, including writing from the areas of critical race studies, feminist theory, and postcolonial theory.

Then, we will look at an array of contemporary artifacts of these fluid encounters, including performance pieces by feminist artists, activists taking on a state, or collaborative educational experiments. As a first year seminar, we will dedicate part of our time to mastering writing as a daily practice.

While precise topics may vary from year to year, the overall goal of the courses remains the same: to familiarize students with the main traditions from which the discipline of anthropology emerged and to explore the diverse ways in which contemporary anthropological practice defines itself both with and against them. This semester our topic will be reflexive anthropology.This course provides an introduction to reflexive/reflective anthropology. We chart the historical development of the field from the making of fieldwork memoirs to its current formulations in more creative ethnographies. Particular attention will be paid to the impact of the interpretive turn speared by Clifford Geertz in the 1970s that advocated the blurring of different genres of writing, which became a feature in contemporary cultural anthropology. The reflexive turn that followed over a decade later demanded ethnographers turn their gaze onto the self to answer questions about the making of otherness, power relations, and representation. Researchers began to consider their position vis-�-vis their intended subjects in the making of ethnographic projects to reinvent and decolonize anthropology. This emphasis has led ethnographers (especially feminists and minorities in the discipline) to engage in more expository writing that further obscured the boundary between social science and literature, which the discipline has historically occupied and continually struggles with. In so doing, they brought particular attention especially to the contested politics in the discipline.The course explores the fundamental features and various approaches to reflexive/reflective work, its challenges and possibilities, and its fervent critics, as well as its embrace by other disciplines. Our ultimate aim is to deconstruct what is the personal and how has it been used to successfully access the social. In the end, we will put theory into practice and produce a significant piece of reflective writing."

These radical critics argued for imagining and building a ""post development"" era. In this course, we ask: What is ""postdevelopment"" as a concept, how does it emerge out of and materialize on the ground among dispossessed communities, and to what effect? We will focus on lived and imagined alternatives to development.

Although unions in the manufacturing sector began to lose momentum in the 1950s, school teachers, police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers, hospital workers, retail clerks, and other previously unorganized workers flocked into organized labor between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s.

This junior colloquium, mindful that the sophomore colloquium ended with social theory up to World War I, will continue to develop this theme, but now with works written since World War II. The course will focus on five post-World War II philosopher/social theorists who have developed compelling large-scale theories about the nature of modern society: Hannah Arendt, Jurgen Habermas, Francis Fukuyama, Friedrich Hayek, and Michel Foucault. The course focuses on these five in part because they are great thinkers who have deep things to say about how we live and how we ought to live today, but also in part because they appropriate materials studied in the sophomore colloquium: Habermas attempts to amend and extend Marx's thought; Fukuyama, the thought of Hegel; Hayek, that of Adam Smith and liberal economists; Foucault, that of Nietzsche; and Arendt's book reads like a meditation not only on the classical Greek philosophy of Aristotle and Plato, but also on the entire corpus of the sophomore colloquium reading list. The course also has the aim of reflecting on the nature of social science, especially in relation to its role in modern society. Thus, it will also explore various aspects of the question, What is involved in social inquiry of the sort studied in the government, economics, and history tutorials in the CSS? As a result, the course is also a course in the metatheory of social analysis (""metatheory"" because it investigates theories about theories of social life). Another reason for picking the five social theorists for the course is that in addition to being important social theorists, they also provide important metatheories of the social studies: Habermas's critical theory, Foucault's genealogy, Hayek's individualism, Fukuyama's idealism, and Arendt's anti-behaviorism."

Turning next to modern ideas of moral action (Kantian and utilitarian), we find that they both emphasize a potential gulf between individual happiness and moral rightness. Yet like the ancients, they disagree over whether morality's basic insights derive from experience. The last third of the course explores more recent preoccupations with ideas about moral difference, moral change, and the relation between morality and power. Especially since Marx and Nietzsche, moral theory faces a sustained challenge from social theorists who allege moral norms and judgments serve hidden ideological purposes. Some have sought to repair universal ethics by giving an account of progress or the overcoming of bias, while others have argued for plural or relative ethics. Ecological critics have challenged moral theorists to overcome their preoccupation with exclusively human interests and ideals.

We will then look at the emergence of a conception of ""material substance"" in the 17th century, examining the differences between the mathematical formulations of Galileo and Descartes and those of atomists such as Gassendi. The remainder of the section will focus on the rise of materialism and reactions against it: Descartes and Hobbes on the question of whether human beings are merely machines, the Newton-Leibniz debate about the activity of God in nature, Laplace's demon and the deterministic interpretation of classical mechanics, and the 19th-century reactions of romanticism and spiritualism.

Some questions the course will consider: How has sex work changed over time, and what do these changes tell us about both the nature of sex work and about the broader society? In what ways is sex work similar to or different from other forms of service labor or other types of intimate relationship? How do questions of race, class, sexuality, and gender alter the meaning and experience of sex work? What sorts of desires and expectations do clients bring to interactions with sex workers, and in what ways have these shifted over time? Recent controversies concerning sex trafficking and underage prostitution will also be addressed, as will the effects of various regulatory schemes that have been developed around the world."

As we study the biology of sex in the animal world, it becomes apparent that sex is achieved in a multitude of ways, many appearing rather bizarre and flamboyant. Yet under these guises, animals are still able to mate and reproduce. Sex is often defined according to sexual reproduction, whereby two individuals that are male and female mate and have offspring. However, many organisms engage in asexual reproduction and/or a combination of the two reproductive strategies. Reproductive anatomy and behavior will be addressed as we explore a variety of organisms, ranging from marine mollusks and their ""sex changes"" to the (female) marmoset monkey that can give birth to chimeras (an offspring with more than two parents). As an organism pursues sex, what are the mating strategies? What are the chemicals of sex (pheromones and hormones)? By examining the biology of sex in detail, we will also debate age-old topics such as whether sexual reproduction is sexist, the competing strategies of males and females, and whether human cultural displays are yet another way to decipher quality in a potential mate."

The objective is to develop a critical sense of the quantitative data currently being obtained from microscopy to spectroscopy, considering both ensemble and single-molecule experiments, and to gain familiarity and facility with interpretation using mathematical and computational models. Biological systems are inherently complex, and some form of modeling is always involved in developing an explanation of how they work. However, these models typically involve only a few basic constructs (simple harmonic motion, ideal fluids, two-state Ising models, random walks, electrostatic interactions, classical dynamics, rate equations, QM energy levels, distribution functions, and network analysis) and only elementary aspects of linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, and statistics. This course deals with how these constructs are integrated in the framework of Boltzmann statistical mechanics to formulate mathematical models of biological phenomena, how these models are validated and refined, and how they are used to form explanations and make testable predictions. Model systems to be considered include the nucleosome, the ribosome, membrane dynamics and ion channels, molecular devices and motors, prototype signal transduction systems, and regulatory processes.

We will look at the amazing diversity of ocean life and the disparate building plans of its animals, and see how oceanic ecosystems are fundamentally different from land ecosystems. Then we will explore how human actions are affecting oceanic ecosystems directly, for instance by overfishing (especially of large predators and filter feeders), addition of nutrients (eutrophication) and pollutants, and the spread of invasive species, as well as indirectly, through emission of carbon compounds into the atmosphere. Rising atmospheric CO2 levels lead to ocean acidification and global warming, affecting the all-important metabolic rates of ocean life, as well as oceanic oxygen levels and stratification, thus productivity.

The purpose of this course is to give you an overview of the powerful array of mathematical tools available for the solution of physical problems. Starting with special functions, we will apply them to the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. We will encounter Fourier and Laplace transforms and will study the Green's function method for the solution of bound and scattering problems. We will also look into the elements of Group theory and apply it to angular momentum in quantum many-body systems."

Introduction to Counterfactual History,FALSE,"What if the Roman Empire had never collapsed? What if the South had won the civil war? What if Hitler had never been born? To ask these questions is to delve into a new field of historical inquiry known as counterfactual history. In the last several decades, the exploration of ""what if?"" scenarios has become a notable phenomenon in Western culture. As seen in countless novels, films, television shows, comic books, plays, and historical essays, the question of how history might have been different has begun to fascinate audiences as never before. This course explores the rise of counterfactual history as a new force in contemporary Western culture. After examining the emergence of counterfactual history against the background of recent political, cultural, and intellectual changes that have taken place in the West, we will investigate how ""what if?"" narratives help us better understand the larger dynamics of history. Counterfactual history, for example, can help us better grasp the deeper aspects of historical causality. Is history driven by great individuals or broad structural forces? If we remove Hitler from German history, do we still witness the rise of Nazism? Studying counterfactual history also helps us appreciate the complexity of drawing moral conclusions about historical events. We can only judge the wisdom of the United States dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, for example, by contemplating what might have happened had it not been done. Finally, we will also explore how counterfactual histories shed light upon the workings of collective memory. What do accounts of what never happened tell us about the memory of what did? We will investigate these and other issues from a theoretical as well as from an empirical perspective, examining a wide range of academic scholarship on counterfactual history as well as primary examples of the genre from the realms of literature, film, and historiography. Our case studies will span many of the pivotal events of modern history, including the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Civil War, the rise of the Third Reich, the outbreak of World War II, the perpetration of the Holocaust, the dropping of the atomic bomb, and the events of the post-9/11 world."

We begin by addressing feminist methodologies, including questions of praxis, representation, and theory. Participants are expected to lead discussions on readings relating to their own projects, submit written work on their senior research in stages (project proposal, annotated bibliography, drafts), and do class presentations."

Any study that aspires to analyze longer periods has to deal with the issues of storing the observations and retrieving them later for analysis. The goal of this course is to show you how to do that--how to connect to various types of databases and how to retrieve and update your data. We will start with relational databases; learn SQL, the language used to query and update the data; and will explore the latest developments in the database field--Hadoop and MapReduce."
