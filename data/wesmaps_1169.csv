We will both investigate the formation of this myth and view it critically, balancing it against the artist's own account of his career in his paintings and prodigious correspondence. Van Gogh's extensive, insightful, and fascinating writing begs the question of how one should treat an artist's statements when interpreting his works. We will also examine the role of biography in art.

Two key exhibitions provide bookends: in Pictures (1977), techniques of appropriation diagnosed a new kind of slippage between reality and representation; in 1993's Whitney Biennial, the period's sustained engagement with gender, sexuality, race, and the relationship between art and politics achieved decisive (and controversial) visibility. Between these poles, artists turned to the street, navigated the ""ends"" of painting, and invented new forms to confront an increasingly image-soaked media-public sphere. The course attends to the strategies of photoconceptualism, painting, sculpture, video, and site-specificity by which artists intervened in a polarizing historical moment that saw the expansion of neoliberal economics and political conservatism, a sharpened divide between rich and poor, the AIDS crisis, and the geopolitical realignments of the late-Cold War."

This course offers an introduction not only to the art and culture of Mughal India, but also to the practice of art history itself, through a sequence of six thematic units exploring and applying different methods that are central to the discipline. Each unit begins with critical reading and discussion of one or two key theoretical or methodological statements, then continues through application to case studies drawn from Mughal India.

This deep uncertainty regarding art's relationship to society coincided with an era of unprecedented formal innovation. Artists struggled to define the costs and benefits of abstraction versus figuration, moving abruptly, even violently, between the two idioms.

These mythical and legendary figures, such as Guanyin, Mazu, and Nie Xiaoqian, empowered both women and men who were in poverty, peril, or despair. Their heroic and divine images combine traits of feminine qualities highlighted in a male-chauvinistic tradition and symbols of a mega-being beyond any gender-specific definition. By tracing the formation and transformation of images of women in the art of China and Taiwan, this course will explore three themes: (1) the development of female cults in the visual cultures of China and Taiwan; (2) the relationship of feminine representation, human morality, and divine power in Chinese and Taiwanese societies; (3) the negotiation of political and cultural identities in these societies through the appropriation of female images.

Other themes explored in the course include cultural continuity, the omnipresence of the classical Roman/pagan culture in Christian empire, the power and use associated with art objects, and the sometimes surprising role of women in the medieval Mediterranean."

Our aim will be to understand the complex artistic and architectural landscape of the period against the backdrop of shifting intellectual and religious trends, such as the Counter-Reformation. Class discussions will be based on close readings of primary sources and scholarly texts on a wide range of topics.This semester the course takes up the thematic prism ""Art as science in Italy: Leonardo to Galileo,"" to examine images, objects, monuments and practices from the history of art circa 1500-1600. We will explore a revaluation of the often opposed historical categories of Science and Art, together with their associated practices, artifacts, and institutions. By considering works of art (understood broadly as artisanal crafts, and the technical and fine arts) from the ambit of Leonardo da Vinci through Galileo Galilei, and their contemporaries, we investigate the possibility that the objective and rational pursuit of natural truths, and the subjective and emotional pursuit of human creativity, were intertwined in the unified Renaissance endeavor to understand and represent the radically changing early modern world, and the embodied experience of living in that world. Themes covered include embodied knowledge, visualizations of imperceptible natural phenomena, aesthetic objects as scientific instruments, the artist's studio as experimental laboratory, and the facilitation of scientific discovery and cultural exchange among diverse communities by means of the circulation of art objects."

Testing the limits of the signable, saleable, and stealable, such techniques have thrown traditional concepts of originality and possessive individualism into arrears while giving rise, quite paradoxically, to some of the most celebrated careers and widely reported lawsuits involving allegations of creative property theft.

We begin with Moses, the first mountain climber. We then turn to the first historical mountain climber: Oetzi, the 5,200 year-old man found frozen in the ice high in the Tyrolian Alps. We then turn to medieval Europe. There, passes through the Alps and the Black Forest were conduits for the transit of men, goods, and cultural forms. Mountains were not barriers but passageways that linked cultures. In 16th- and 17th-century Europe, Netherlandish artists--Breughel, Seghers, Ruisdael, Jos de Mompers--first gave full expression to the grandeur, far beyond a human scale, of Alpine scenery. Gradually, mountains came to be viewed as places of aesthetic beauty and as manifestation of the sublime. Romanticism, in the visual arts, poetry, and music, captures the experience of the Alps as both symbol and physical manifestation of the transcendent. In the paintings of C. D. Friedrich, Constable, and Turner, mountains become the means to express the concept of the sublime. A deeper understanding of the sublime may be found in the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge. In America, too, mid-19th century painters focused on the mountains. We will study Hudson River School artists represented in Connecticut collections (Church, Cole). The mid-19th century saw the birth of mountaineering as a sport. We will read selections from narratives of climbing expeditions--Leslie Stephen, Mark Twain. After World War I, mountaineering took on a heightened spiritual dimension for men who had survived the horrors of trench warfare. In Austria and Germany, climbing was identified with the cult of physical prowess and, sadly, with National Socialism and anti-Semitism. In fact, however, the development of climbing and skiing in the Alps owes much to Austrian and German Jews. In art, too, during the first decades of the 20th century, mountains were an important source of spiritual inspiration for painters whose work is central to the evolution of modern art."

Understood as the intention to re-unite the arts into one integrated work, the total work of art was tied from the beginning to the desire to recover and renew the public function of art. While there exist many approaches to totality in the modern era, this course focuses on modernist theories and practices that simultaneously critiqued existing society and posited a utopian alternative. We will begin by studying formulations of totality in response to a cultural crisis initiated by the 1789 French Revolution. From there, we turn to German idealism and to an analysis of composer Richard Wagner's ideas and compositions that made the idea of the synthesis of the arts a central focus for European modernism. Yet if Wagner's works and writings provided the dominant reference for subsequent developments from the 1880s onward, these most often consisted of a search for alternatives to his own theory and practice, particularly in the visual arts. We will examine attempts to envision totality after Wagner in impressionist painting and German expressionism. Ideas of totality and utopia continued to carry positive associations for modern artists until the 1930s, when they became co-opted by totalitarian governments. The course concludes by examining the perversion of modernist dreams in Nazi festivals and art exhibitions."

What we will discover in this course is that many of the modes, topics, techniques, and aims of comedy most familiar to us were employed by the ancient Greeks and Romans; often our own version owes a substantial debt to theirs. Comedic literature will also offer us a unique look at Greek and Roman culture, set as it is- much like our own comedy and satire- in a skewed version of everyday ""reality.""  This course will be organized into three main units, structured around three main modes of ancient comic literature: dramatic comedy (the precursor to modern situation comedy), satire (a forerunner of stand-up comedy), and comic narrative (the wellspring of the comic novel). At the end of the course, we will return to three masterpieces in each mode- Aristophanes- Frogs, Juvenals- Satires, and Petronius- Satyricon- and apply the critical tools we have developed to a richer analysis of the interaction between these texts and the society of readers and authors that produced them."

In reading carefully a wide range of ancient texts and modern scholarly discussions, we will be thinking on several levels at once. That is, we will learn about the gods and ritual practices of ancient Greece and Rome and also think critically about the agendas of the many writers-from Plato to Thomas Jefferson and beyond-who described them for their own purposes.How did Jesus of Nazareth come to be understood as a god, who dies and rises, in a world brimming with gods? Why was he remembered as a philosopher and a martyr, like Socrates? How-and with what motives-did writers throughout history compare Jesus with the priests and kings of ancient Israel or with the gods and goddesses of the Hellenistic Mystery Religions? What is the place of Demeter, Isis, and Osiris in the history of religion? How did early Christians understand their rituals of death and resurrection in terms of rebirth, salvation, and martyrdom? Considering themes and theories of piety and sacrifice, purity and prophecy, wisdom and narrative, ethics and philosophy, mythmaking and cultural critique, we will ask how the politics of comparison and classification have shaped not only our understanding of Jesus and Judaism, ancient Greece and Rome, but also the construction of Judaism and Christianity as religions, and the very category of religion itself."

This course hopes to serve as an intervention into this perceived divide through close readings of these groundbreaking cinematic works and an examination of their revolutionary content in the interest of articulating shared philosophical concerns.  In many cases, New Wave filmmakers worked as writers and critics before producing films themselves, a fact that speaks to the intensely theoretical nature of their cinema.  This course will therefore examine critical writings published in the space of Cahiers du Cinema, Film Art, and other journals as a means of better understanding the thought process that underlies these films.  How do these films figure as a response to that of the previous generation and how did they hope to revolutionize cinematic praxis?  What was their relationship to political activism and the events of 1968?  Finally, we will consider the legacy of these cinemas:  What is the prevailing influence of the New Wave on Hollywood and global cinema?  What aspects of the movement have been retained and what has been lost along the way?"

What position does Japan for Korea and Korea for Japan occupy in the cultural imagination and how has this image shifted since the end of the colonial period?  What role does Japan have in the formation of the North Korean state and articulation of ideology?  How do political developments and ongoing issues of war responsibility (comfort women, etc.) continue to dictate the state of Korea-Japan relations?  This course will also examine the influence peripheral spaces (such as Jeju Island) and marginalized groups (such as the Korean minority in Japan) have in mediating discourse between these nations.  Finally, recent cinematic works such as Assassination (2015) and Spirits' Homecoming (2016) have witnessed a rekindled interest in the colonial period.

In this seminar, we will consider the history and legacy of the Spanish Inquisition, which existed for 356 years (1478-1834) and operated in both Spain and Spain's colonies overseas. We will examine not only the historical record itself (e.g., transcripts of actual trials, individual case studies), but also various depictions of the Inquisition found in imaginative media (art, literature, and film). Our subject, then, will be the Spanish Inquisition both real and imagined. Why did this institution arise in the first place? How did it survive for as long as it did?

This course will approach the problems and possibilities of the city for realism through a close reading of two large, ambitious texts that attempt to represent the city as a totality: James Joyce's novel ULYSSES (1922) and David Simon's television series THE WIRE (2002-2008).

Ways of Reading courses develop strategies for careful and close reading, and techniques for the analysis of literary forms such as poetry and drama, and prose narratives such as novels and short stories. They familiarize students with some of the protocols of the literary-critical essay, examine the idea of literature as a social institution, and explore ways of connecting textual details and the world beyond the text. The ways of reading learned in the course are powerful tools for critically assessing discourses that expand far beyond the realm of literature. So while students will become adept literary critics, they also will learn quickly that to be a literary critic is to read critically and carefully all the time: in poems, novels, and plays, but also in political speech, in popular culture, and in the discourses that shape everyday life. This course investigates dramatic adaptations that have originated from poetry, short stories, novels, and historical events. Through multiple modes of inquiry, we interrogate form, genre, narrative, aesthetic, and intended audience as well as the social, political, gender, sexuality, and/or racial context of each literary piece. Within these various ""page to stage"" adaptation processes, we track the evolution of our source texts and chart the longevity and changeable dynamics of elements, such as character, theme, plot, point of view, setting, and time, as they appear within each dramatic iteration."

Times of emergency and crisis will also command attention, specifically the Paris Commune of 1871; the Dreyfus Affair of the 1890s; the Great War of 1914-1918; the Popular Front of the 1930s; the military defeat of 1940; the drama of collaboration or resistance, 1940-1944; and the early years of the Fifth Republic, 1958-1969."

After an initial period of discussion based on readings, we will hold conversations with members of our campus community who have experienced various forms of authoritarianism. The goal of the course is ultimately project-based: as we gain perspective on the issue of political turmoil, we will turn what we learn into well-informed, measured, concrete action. In particular, we will workshop several writing exercises related to the topic and destined to make an impact (letter to the editor, letter to an elected official, public service announcement for the radio, etc).

What human beings have accomplished is probably unique in the history of the universe; once lost to war, famine, and ecological collapse, the understandings and physical creations of our cultures will be irrecoverable. We must ask ourselves, with considerable urgency, the following questions: How do our values, our economic systems, and our behaviors--as individuals, groups, societies, and cultures--affect the conditions under which we, our descendants, and the plants and animals with which we share the earth might live in the future? To what extent and at what cost can technology enable us to adapt to changes already under way? Should we take an ""apr�s moi, le déluge"" attitude or try to prolong the life of our species, and if so, in what form? Does the so-called simple life, as conceptualized in different times and places, offer any useful models? Does living ""green"" make sense? What about environmental (in)justice? This course will draw on texts from a variety of periods and disciplines, written in a range of styles and from many perspectives, to examine how these questions and others can be approached.

Germans are credited for extraordinary achievements in the arts, sciences, and industry, yet they also produced some of history's darkest chapters. This introductory course surveys the fascinating and turbulent history of modern Germany to analyze the sources of these contradictions. We will begin by locating the birth of modern Germany in the massive social and political upheavals of the Napoleonic era that set the stage for the rise of German nationalism and rapid industrialization. We will study the unlikely processes that resulted in German unification in 1871 and how Germany's nationalism, growing industrial power, and its deep internal divisions led to a policy of aggressive imperialism that contributed to the outbreak of the First World War. The course will analyze the profound impact of that war and defeat on German society, situating both the Weimar Republic and the rise of Hitler in that context. We will subsequently study Nazism, the Second World War, and Holocaust, as well as the ultimate destruction of Germany as sovereign state with its surrender and military occupation in 1945. The remainder of the course explores the phoenixlike rebirth of two competing German states in the Cold War and the subsequent parallel development and divergence of two German societies. We will conclude the course by analyzing the process that led to German reunification in 1990 and the lines of development of the ""Berlin Republic"" since that time. The aims of the course are to introduce students to historical primary sources, the skills of historical analysis, and the questions of historiography through a coherent introductory survey of modern German history."

Employing socially and environmentally engaged musicological analysis, this course will focus on five distinct areas: We will analyze how environmental sites and situations are represented in music; examine why environmentalist ideologies are integrated into the musical narratives and/or sonic choices made by the artist; address how artists conceptualize the environment and express their relationship to it; grapple with what motivates these artists to incorporate environmental commentary into their compositions, illustrating how sociocultural and environmental factors influence creative expression; and question how personal and societal values concerning relationships between society and the environment are disseminated and constructed through music. We will also explore the various ways in which nature, urbanity, and environment are constructed in the production, performance, consumption, and reception of music. Through our reading discussions, writing, and applied projects some of the questions we will address include: How do the intersections of landscapes and cityscapes produce multifarious artistic responses? How are communities whose economy depend on, or historically depended on, energy and/or natural resource industries signified or evoked through music? How are past and present histories of place expressed, recorded, and remembered through detailed and affective sensory experience? How do we determine the health of our soundscapes? How is music and sound mobilized in social activism? How are notions of identity, as shaped by a physical environment and the ideologies connected to place, constructed and communicated? As we engage with the critical geography of sound, we will address the global networks, musical mobilities, circulation of sounds, traditions and musicians, and the ways in which landscape, mapping, urban planning, and landscapes are expressed in music."

The Spanish-speaking world has been affected by this phenomenon in particular ways, in both Spain and North America. In this course, we will study how Spanish, Mexican, and Chicano playwrights and stage artists working in various genres have responded to this reality, how and why they have chosen to craft the collective experience of the border as performance, and how they have addressed the cultural and political tensions that are associated with this experience. The framework for our study will be comparative in both content and format. We will focus on two borders--the Strait of Gibraltar and the R�o Grande (Río Bravo)--and on the two corresponding migratory experiences: from North and sub-Saharan Africa into Spain; from Latin America into the U.S. This course will be taught simultaneously at Wesleyan and at the Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, Spain.

The term psychophysical action was coined by Russian director and pedagogue Konstantin Stanislavsky, who dedicated his life's work to the elaboration of the first Western acting system. Stanislavsky viewed the acting conventions of Romanticism and melodrama as ""false,"" inadequate, and pass�. As a proponent of realism, then an emerging theatrical genre, Stanislavsky sought to develop an acting system that would support the creation of ""truthful"" actions on stage. The late Polish director Jerzy Grotowski continued Stanislavsky's research on the method of psychophysical actions. In response to the theatrical trends of his time, Grotowski's own research aimed at freeing actors from the conventions and materials of realism. Instead of departing from dramatic literature, students in this course will learn how to create psychophysical actions using points of departure such as personal memory, short stories, poems, visual materials, objects, traditional song, and so forth. The goal is to guide them to create repeatable scores of psychophysical actions; select, extend, and/or omit specific fragments in their score; juxtapose text or song to the physical score; and use objects in a manner that is precise and expressive. During the second half of the semester, students will learn how to ""edit"" their scores of psychophysical actions in partner and ensemble work.

Considering a variety of critical, literary, and visual texts, we will examine how African American images and culture became a way for working-class and other whites to negotiate their own identities and how African American artists and intellectuals have responded to this troubling legacy. In the second half of the course, we will turn our attention to questions of cultural representation that originate from the racial context often deemed to be the opposite of the African American experience: that of Asian Americans. If African Americans have long been the target of overtly negative stereotypes, Asian Americans have been subjected to what one critic has called ""racist love""--that is, a tradition of putatively positive stereotypes that have produced a different set of representational problems for Asian Americans.

Issues of health and illness are, quite literally, matters of life and death that are shaped by broader political and economic institutions in human societies. In neoliberal nation states like the U.S., the guardian of the right to live a healthy life is a highly bureaucratic and technological form of corporate medicine. Medicine comprises a network of social institutions and technoscientific practices that people have created and use to diagnose and heal our bodily and psychic ills.

Who thrives, who gets sick, who dies, and why constitute core questions for social justice. This course investigates the complex embroidery of biosocial and cultural processes that shape the unequal experiences and meanings of health. Cultural studies of health document the role of medicine as a great instrument of power that both generates and alleviates suffering.

While the temporal lens of the course will be broad, spanning almost a century, the geographical focus will be limited to the continents of North and South America. Thematically, we will explore three intersecting topics that are highly relevant -- but by no means exclusive -- to ""the Americas."" They include (1) colonialism, health, and subjectivity; (2) the workings of neoliberalism; and (3) ethnography between ""darkness"" and ""the good."" The hands-on portion of the course will allow students to apply what they learn during the semester toward designing and implementing their own ethnographic research project."

Individual sessions focus on critical issues and episodes that shaped this historical development. Some sessions center on significant diseases or health issues, such as diabetes or mental health; other sessions examine public health and community initiatives, forms of resistance, or modes of strategic intervention, such as new health legislation, the development of community-controlled health services, or transnational alliance-building. Overall, the course is premised on the idea that health is a social and political condition as much as a scientific and medical one.

This semester our topic will be anthropology and the person. Anthropology has long been haunted by the problem of the person. The classic anthropological traditions define personhood as socially/culturally constructed, which is to say that individuals receive from society/culture the concepts and values through which they understand and experience themselves as well as the wider world. Social variation in notions of personhood tended to be represented in binary terms, as a distinction between modern Western individualism and a construction attributed to ""other"" societies (both premodern and non-Western) of the person as a social being whose private life is subordinated to public roles and obligations. While this binary model foregrounded potentially significant differences between societies with regard to the expression and valorization of subjectivity, it also discouraged attention to differences within societies, and its emphasis on determinism obscured questions of agency, creativity, reflexivity, power, contestation, and change. Contemporary anthropology works both with and against the binary to explore the interplay between social and individual aspects of personhood in particular sociohistorical contexts. In this course we will begin with selected works from classic anthropological traditions and then go on to review and assess various works in contemporary cultural theory and ethnographic writing that take personhood as a focus of inquiry. Among the themes and questions we will pursue are the romantic origins of the culture concept and the formation of romantic personhood; embodied knowledge, practice theory, and models of agency; personhood and gift-giving; the social boundaries of personhood; sociality and personhood online."

The growth and challenge of royal and parliamentary power will frame the last parts of the course that anticipate the revolutionary crisis of the 17th century. Along the way, the course will ask, Who gets to make law, what is the role of writing in the development of custom and law, how did the English decide who was right and who wrong: calculation, testimony, jury, or ordeal? What were the forms of punishment and compensation employed, and what did this tell us of conceptions of the person: mutilation, execution, or incarceration? How did social status and gender shape expectations and outcomes in the legal process: Who could be a legal actor, a responsible malefactor, a property owner, or a slave; who could be judge and legislator? The course will be based on the examination both of recent scholarship and a wide array of primary sources such as law codes, court record books, advice manuals, literature, treatises on law, and the practical documents from lawyers in courts and judges that are plentiful in medieval, Tudor, and Stuart England. The course provides a background to the sources of law in early America as well as other common law countries around the world."

Ecology is typically associated with a skeptical stance toward economic growth and human intervention in the environment, while economics focuses on understanding (and often, celebrating) human activities of production, consumption, and growth. At the same time, ecology and economics share a common etymology: both words spring from the Greek oikos, or household. They also share much common history. This course thus explores the parallel histories of economics and ecology from the 18th century to the present, focusing on changing conceptions of the oikos over this period, from cameralism's vision of the household as a princely estate or kingdom, continuing through the emergence of ideas about national or imperial economic development, and culminating in the dominant 20th-century recasting of economics as being centrally concerned with problems of resource allocation. Simultaneously, it explores connections between changes in economics and the emergence of ecological science over this period, from Enlightenment natural history and early musings on the ""economy of nature,"" to the design of markets for carbon credits today."

Through brief theoretical readings and historical case studies, we explore such themes as the relationship between colonialism and the written word, the enduring legacy of alternative indigenous literacies, the importance of rumor and oral communication in societies with low literacy rates, and the role of mass media in identity formation and contemporary social movements. Structured in part as a lab, the class will be organized around producing a physical and digital exhibition of Latin American media materials available in Wesleyan's collections, to be displayed for the broader university community and beyond. We will produce this exhibition over the course of the semester, integrating individual research projects into our broader collective project which will be conducted as a collaborative/team effort.

Yet both insist that moral life is essentially connected to individual happiness. Turning next to modern ideas of moral action (Kantian and utilitarian), we find that they both emphasize a potential gulf between individual happiness and moral rightness. Yet like the ancients, they disagree over whether morality's basic insights derive from experience. The last third of the course explores more recent preoccupations with ideas about moral difference, moral change, and the relation between morality and power. Especially since Marx and Nietzsche, moral theory faces a sustained challenge from social theorists who allege moral norms and judgments serve hidden ideological purposes. Some have sought to repair universal ethics by giving an account of progress or the overcoming of bias, while others have argued for plural or relative ethics. Ecological critics have challenged moral theorists to overcome their preoccupation with exclusively human interests and ideals. What kinds of moral reflection might be adequate to problems of global interdependence?

As an academic field dedicated to a collective engagement with the ways power constitutes bodies, knowledge, and ways of being in the world, sociology is a key venue for contending with these processes. This course will introduce students to the emerging field of critical university studies through a feminist, queer, and anti-racist frame.

What does it mean to consider the university's history in relationship to power and the nation-state? What are the gender, sexual, class, and racial politics of knowledge production?

In this class, we will interrogate these areas alongside blackness, womanhood, and sexuality to fully consider the implications of body size as a substantial category of intersectional analysis. By bringing medical and sociological studies into conversations with political and feminist theory, while also engaging with literary pieces and popular culture, this interdisciplinary course aims to equip all of us with a deeper understanding of sexuality and body size and their significance in the lives of black women. We will journey our way through this course using the works of black feminists such as Patricia Hill Collins, theorists such as Michel Foucault, sociologists like Samantha Kwan, political scientists such as Cathy Cohen, lawyers like Dorothy Roberts and Paul Campos, and writers such as Lucille Clifton and Alice Walker. In addition, we will bring our lived experiences and proximity to popular culture (think magazines, music, films, and online resources such as personal blogs) to stake out our own truths and fill out any gaps that we believe are present in the literature.

In this context, we will reflect on how theories of child development, student motivation, classroom management, and pedagogy inform instructional practice. Finally, the third major topic that will be covered is how to determine whether schools are achieving their stated goals. We will examine the appropriate (and inappropriate) uses of assessment for understanding whether students are learning, whether teachers are effective, and whether a school has a positive or negative climate."

While this kind of writing tends to be timely, as almost all journalism must be when it's first published, at its best, it ought to be worth reading for decades to come. Truman Capote, for example, conceived of IN COLD BLOOD, which he first published as a series of articles in THE NEW YORKER in 1965, as a ""non-fiction novel"": a work of journalism that employed the techniques and artistry of fiction. We will study the writing of new journalists like Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe, Nora Ephron, and Gay Talese, who pioneered the idea that there is no such thing as unbiased reporting: The writer can't help but bring a point of view to his or her storytelling, so why not admit it? These writers broke with journalistic convention and admitted that there was an ""I"" behind the typewriter, a mediator between the ""true"" story and the reader. We will focus on reading and writing two forms in particular, the profile and the essay. While an excellent profile can be a straightforward examination of another person and his or her place in the world, in the hands of a master like Janet Malcolm or George Trow, it can become an eruption of invention. Essays ask a question or argue a point--but how? There are as many ways as there are writers who explore the form, and in this course we will seek to join them.The course will be taught by Steve Almond, the 2016-17 Koeppel Journalism Fellow. He has been an investigative journalist in Miami and El Paso and is an award-winning writer of nonfiction and fiction.

Serving to complement courses currently offered within biology that only touch upon the subject of sex, this course will dive into specifics regarding sexual behavior and will serve to highlight new discoveries that have been facilitated by novel scientific techniques and approaches. As we study the biology of sex in the animal world, it becomes apparent that sex is achieved in a multitude of ways, many appearing rather bizarre and flamboyant. Yet under these guises, animals are still able to mate and reproduce. Sex is often defined according to sexual reproduction, whereby two individuals that are male and female mate and have offspring. However, many organisms engage in asexual reproduction and/or a combination of the two reproductive strategies. Reproductive anatomy and behavior will be addressed as we explore a variety of organisms, ranging from marine mollusks and their ""sex changes"" to the (female) marmoset monkey that can give birth to chimeras (an offspring with more than two parents). As an organism pursues sex, what are the mating strategies? What are the chemicals of sex (pheromones and hormones)? By examining the biology of sex in detail, we will also debate age-old topics such as whether sexual reproduction is sexist, the competing strategies of males and females, and whether human cultural displays are yet another way to decipher quality in a potential mate."

(2) The ethics of neuroscience, i.e. the ethical implications of manipulating the brain. The first perspective will relate to the premise that human morality is embodied in and operates based on the principles of the functional architecture of the brain, in particular, the cerebral cortex. The course will examine the organization and neural networks, especially of the association cortices (prefrontal Cortex - ventromedial, dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortex; the cingulate cortex; temporal association cortex; and the inferior and superior parietal lobes). The course will review studies on the development of moral values in children and their neural underpinnings, leading to studies of the functions of the adult brain in moral or ethical decision-making. Topics such as the neural basis of resolving the ""Trolley Problem"", neuroeconomics, altruism, poverty, forgiveness, compassion will provide the basis for this discussion. We will evaluate from a neuroscience perspective questions such as determinism and free will, and the sense of ""self"", which ideas have played a significant role in ethical theories.

Whose lives are privileged over others and with what consequences? How are certain bodies made killable and others grievable?
